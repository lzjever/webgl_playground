# webgl_playground
This is a WebGL demo which is a assignment of a job interview. 

It's a very simple demo but includes every essential part of WebGL programming.
I think it also has a value for beginners who want to learn WebGL.


You can use this demo code whatever you want, but take your own risk!




In this demo , shaders are regenerated and compiled at every single annimation frame just for simplicity, which is a huge performance problem. You should just input variables(vertex) into GLSL from js part in a real product.
